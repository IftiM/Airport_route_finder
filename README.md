# Airport_route_finder

We have 3 data files to work with: airlines.dat, airports.dat and routes.dat
These files includes all known list of Airlines, Airports, and International Routes.
Our task is to get any two airport code: as source airport and destination airport.
Then we have to find if there's any direct flight between those two routes, if there's
any 2 legged routes between them, and if there's any 3 legged routes between them.
